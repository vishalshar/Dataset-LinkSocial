I keep an eye for the next great thing to do and live life trying to get the most of my experiences.  I'm currently finishing my bachelor in Corporate Communication / Marketing. And these days, my focus is on optimization. I try to tune methods and tools each time I use or do something. Almost nothing scares me. I'm an open minded individual, looking to value my being and help others change the world we all live in.
