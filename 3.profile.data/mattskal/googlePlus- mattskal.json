{"userName": "MattSkallerud", "bio": "LGBT Online Marketing professionally... Personally, I love traveling the world and meeting interesting, exciting new people. I learned early on that at the end of the day, who or what I remember has so much less to do with the little things in life, and all about the people I've met who have moved me or changed my life in some small or great way. Associating these people and these events with a time and a place, both physical and in my life, makes for the greatest memories I can ever ask for.
