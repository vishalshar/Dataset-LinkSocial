{"userName": "MoniBrown", "bio": "I'm not amazingly interesting, but since I'm the only me someone thinks I must be. Who knows? I am a self proclaimed blogger, I take classes full-time for my computer science, and I'm a fantastic mom (also self proclaimed). I play a lot of games on Facebook, my phone, and my consoles but I suck at shooters. I'm also a soccer mom and a band mom. My family keeps me busy and broke.  I'd be lost without all of them. This year I made some new friends (I'm very bad at making new friends) and I got another year older. Unfortunately, unlike most women I agree every single year. I just realized my birthday was coming around again. I really wish it would stop sneaking up on me. Now to give you my warning label. I say a couple bad words, nothing to awful, I am extremely sarcastic, I'm working on that because some people think I'm mean, but mainly you might be one of those people who causes every comment out of my mouth to be dropping with more sarcasm than you've ever received broke in your life. So, in advance, sorry (kind of, maybe a little bit). I'm all honesty, I'm probably not sorry at all. People who can't take it I'm perfectly fine with you deleting me or muting me if you want to stalk me.
