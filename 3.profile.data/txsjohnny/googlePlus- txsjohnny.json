{"userName": "JohnnyGeorgeJr", "bio": "There is no excercise better for the heart than reaching down & lifting people up.  Saluton mondo!  The same man who will be at your side & stay at your side. A calming figure I have become, with a strong nurturing side & instinctively protective to those I care for.  Seeded with a soft & kind heart I have a great respect for life & for nature.  I am amalgamated by maturing experiences & creative thinking, also compensating & practical, seeking solutions rather than dwell on long lasting arguments.  Yet I am simple in some ways, a boy at heart, feeling that warmth of a naive joyous tingle within. Too forgiving at times.
