(The count continues as I'm continuing to work there.)  As part of my passion of being a #DVWarrior, I also run a radio show on BlogTalkRadio called Beyond Words Live, and am a part of the Survivors' Caucus, Survivors' Voices, and Legal Advocacy Network, as well as run a Domestic Violence Voices page on fb.  I'm interactive with many other organizations on fb and other sites who share my passion.
