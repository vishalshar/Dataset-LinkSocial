{"userName": "LisbethJimenez", "bio": "Nerdy, book lover interested in just about everything. Hi nice to meet you, I don't do hang outs with strangers!  I like talking meeting intelligent, honest, kind, empathetic people. If you have knowledge spread some my way. I tend to ride the fence because I can see both sides on any given position. I am open minded and I enjoy a sense of humor. I do not enjoy mean spirited people who make fun of others. If you hate women dont bother circling me. If you have anger issues dont circle me. For the rest of you who have read this far, I look forward to meting you on our G+ journey.
