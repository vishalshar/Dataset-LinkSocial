{"userName": "SariGrove", "bio": "So we put our cool new original awesome excellent medical theory into a chart, then we wrote a book to explain the chart(Grove Body Part Chart:A medical Arts innovation), then we wrote another book called DIY medicine:A repair manual, & now we are writing a third book called Algae+Rhythm, Algae-Rhyme:Apt surgical rotation App, & then we called this series the Grove health Science Series, & Amazon told us we should give people a free read so we could get readers & become known as authorities, so we did do that, & so if you go to our website at http://www.GroveCanada.ca you can totally read all three books for free(yes even the 3rd one, while it is still in progress can be read)...& now people are telling us things like that is so great & what you are saying is true & people are getting well-er, I mean better, & well that is a good thing & also watch the explaining video on the site too, cause that is easier than reading & we promise we are trying to make that video more exciting, which is harder cause it's like 23 minutes, but worth it for the content...
